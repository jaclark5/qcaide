# OpenFF Alkane Torsion Drives v1.0

## Description

A torsion drive data set created to improve the coverage of alkane and alkene
parameters in Sage.

## QCSubmit Generation Pipeline

* `generate-dataset.py`: This script shows how the dataset was prepared from the input file `input.smi`.
* The list of SMILES in `input.smi` were curated by hand to correspond to
alka/ene parameters missing coverage in Sage.

## QCSubmit Manifest

* `generate-dataset.py`: Script describing dataset generation and submission
* `input.smi`: Input SMILES
* `input-environment.yaml`: Environment file used to create Python environment for the script
* `full-environment.yaml`: Fully-resolved environment used to execute the script
* `td.toml`: Experimental input file for defining variables used throughout the QCA submission process
* `dataset.json.bz2`: Compressed dataset ready for submission
* `dataset.pdf`: Visualization of dataset molecules
* `dataset.smi`: Smiles strings for dataset molecules
